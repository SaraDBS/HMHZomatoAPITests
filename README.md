# APIPracticalTechnicalTest

**Demonstrating Knowledge of REST APIs automation**

##### Tests were written in Java using REST Assured Java, Maven and JUnit
##### Tests are contained in the CitiesEndpointTests.java class and I also created a test runner class AllApiTest.java and tests can be triggered from there 
Tests can also be run from the CitiesEndpointTests.java class itself or from the command line with the following command:  mvn test
##### I tried to cover a lot of scenarios, specially the ones related to query parameters and I also covered authentication tests.
##### Given more time I would probably add some more scenario combinations, I noticed the q (city name) query parameter overrides all the other parameters
and I touched on that briefly in one of the tests but could have probably add more coverage and different combinations.
